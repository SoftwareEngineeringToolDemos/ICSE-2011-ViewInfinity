This VM has been created for the Tool View Infinity.
View infinity was presented in ICSE 2011 By Dr. Michael Stengel, Dr. Mathias Frisch, Dr. Sven Apel, Dr. Janet Feigenspan, Dr. Christian Kästner & Dr. Raimund Dachselt.

View Infinity is a tool that provides seamless and semantic zooming of different abstraction layers of an SPL(Software Product Line).
It allows users to zoom sealessly between 3 layers of abstraction of an SPL: Feature model using feature model view, file structure using file view and source code using code view. By zooming into items View Infinity offers developers an information filter mechanism.
Thus View Infinity allows developers to explore an SPL from its feature model down to its implementation.

This VM contains:
1. View Infinity Binary Folder which contains the executable tool, two example java files/codes used by the authors in their paper & the Source code zip file.
2. License Folder that contains the license of the software
3. Installation.txt that explains how to install the tool from scratch
4. Readme.txt that explians how get started with the tool
5. ViewInfinity on VM link that opens a youtube video that shows how to use the tool in this vm 

Using the Tool:
	1. Click on the View Infinity shortcut on the desktop
	2. Import your SPL program / import the example SPL program provided by the authors
	3. The tool generates the 3 different zoomable views for the given SPL program

** The tool only works on Windows OS
